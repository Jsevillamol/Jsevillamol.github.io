I am working towards a better understanding and management of Artificial Intelligence.
Background in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

I am currently studying trends in Machine Learning, and economics of AI at [Epoch](https://epochai.org/).  
My ambition is to deliver a scientific understanding of what is driving innovation in AI, and sketch the path of the technology in future decades.

Besides my main job, I am striving towards better management of global risk through my roles as director of the [Observatorio de Riesgos Catastróficos Globales](https://riesgoscatastroficosglobales.com/) and research affiliate to the [Center for the Study of Existential Risk](https://www.cser.ac.uk/) of Cambridge University.
